 $at is a register typically for the assembler to support the ""pseudo instruction"" -> ""real MIPS instruction"" conversions, but you can use it, it is not a reserved register (unlike the $gp, $fp, $sp registers). Having said that, unless the instruction you are executing would modify $at, there is no need to change it.
 
 You are NOT asked to change the register values, you only need to change the registers when the execution outcome of the instruction would change their values.
 
 Write the instructions like what you would do in MARS, provide clearly the instruction name, the register names, immediate value, label(write the offset directly), or any other relevant information.

 From 2nd to 3rd instruction, i understand why it is needed to wait for one cycle. But why 2 cycles? Why can't we have the data from exe in the 2nd instruction forwarded to the exe in the 3rd instruction?",0,Updated 1 year ago by Anonymous Scale,,"This question is a bit tricky:
 
 The third instruction depends on the ""lw"" and the earlier ""add"" instructions on $s1 and $s2 respectively. Forwarding only exists from ALU output->ALU inputs, so the earliest time the third instruction can get the updated $s1 value (i.e. by doing ID) is in (the second half of) the clock cycle 5 after after ""lw"" is done with WB (in the first half of the clock cycle). But then if you align this third instruction accordingly, you will notice that it will not be able to get updated value of $s2 from the earlier ""add"" (i.e. the required forwarding is Mem->ALU, but this does not exist according to the problem description). Therefore the only way to get the updated value of $s2 is through ID, and therefore the third instruction can only do ID when the earlier ""add"" is done with WB in the first half of clock cycle 6.",2,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,3,

 This is not necessary. First line of the problem states that $$n \ge 2.$$
 Your code may also assume that assumption for the data. SO, an exception is not needed.

 Since the exception case is not needed this is not an issue

 Yes. You may define procedures and functions with your pseudocode.

 Technically, no. It’s an item. Multiple items may have the same key. This can occur with Binary Search Trees as well. An item may be a record and multiple records might have the same key.
 
 But, if it makes it simpler, for the sake of this problem, you may assume that all items have unique keys.
 Just specify in advance that you are using that assumption.
 
 so in (II) and (III), the input is a key and we have to find the node(s) that contain(s) the key
 Or some node that contains the key (if there are multiple such nodes). The same as for BSTs)
 
 
 or insert the key in some node (respectively).
 Not exactly. In this last case you need to create a new tree that contains all the old keys and the new key.
 
 The easiest way to do this is to try to insert the key into the appropriate leaf and then, if the resulting tree violates the rules, fix that.
 
 If yes, if more than one node contain the key do we have to find all the nodes in (II)? In (III), are we allowed to change the number of nodes?
 No. The resulting tree must contain exactly all of the old items in the tree as well as the new item that has been inserted

 No. You need to prove the correctness of your bases case(s) and then prove your general induction step separately.
 
 I'm not quite sure how it's even possible (in a clean induction for these problems ) for the base case and the general case to be similar.

 If you can come up with an induction hypothesis that permits using weak induction, by all means use it.
 
 BUT, when proving correctness of a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm it can be messy to use weak induction. That's because problems of size n usually do NOT recursively call problems of size $$n-1$$. They call SMALLER subproblems. So, Strong induction is more natural in this case and I recommend using it.
 
 All of the (informal) ""proofs"" of correctness that we have done in class have actually used strong induction.

If $$i > j$$ then the tree exists, but it is empty, so it has cost $$0.$$While this might seem arbitrary, this is actually how the recurrence taught in class worked.The issue there was that, when constructing $$T_{i,j}$$, it is possible that $$a_i$$ or $$a_j$$ is the root.In that case, the left or right subtree would be empty. The recurrence therefore needed the cost of that empty subtree to be $$0$$. This is why we set $$e[i,i-1]=0$$ in class.[Sidenote: Setting $$e[i,i-1]=0$$ was just a mathematical hack. BUT, introducing it meant that we didn't have to write out special cases of the recurrence when the root is the leftmost or rightmost item in the range. So, it was a useful hack.]The cases in which we nust set $$e[i,j:k] = \infty$$ are very different. These are cases in which the range of items is non-empty but the tree with the stated property can not exist. For example, the tree containing a range with 4 items ($$a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}$$) MUST have height at least $$2$$. So $$e[i,i+3:1]=\infty$$Again, this is a mathematical hack. You COULD write a more complicated recurrence that first checks whether a tree could exist before calculating its associated value. But, setting the cost $$=\infty$$ does this automatically.This is actually why we permit you to do calculations with $$\infty$$ in your pseudocode. In real code, that's impossible.

 ""Initial conditions"" refers to the base conditions that need to be set.
 These are the values that are NOT defined by the recurrence.
 
 There are actually two slightly different types of initial conditions that can occur.
 
 a) those that refer to the ""smallest"" base problems, i.e.,
 $$e[i,i] = f(a_i).$$
 These are the costs of the one node trees
 
 b) Those that refer to boundary issues in the recurrence, e.g.
 $$f(i,j)=0$$ for $$i>j.$$
 $$i >j$$ refers to non-existent problem, e.g., the empty set.
 Setting this $$-0$$ is saying that the cost of an empty tree is zero.
 and makes the recurrence work nicely.
 
 Both types are called initial conditions
 
 ***********************
 A bit deeper. For this problem, (b) was not actually necessary.
 You could have avoided this mathematical hack by not defining $$e[i,j]$$ for $$i > j$$ and changing the recurrence to
 
 $$e[i,j] = w[i,j] + \min\left( e[i+1,j], e[i,j-1], \min_{i < k < j} (e_[i,k-1]+e[ k+1,j])\right)$$
 
 Note that this new recurrence has peeled off the two cases of $$a_i$$ and $$a_j$$ being the tree roots and dealt with them separately. It's also mathematically correct and, possibly, more intuitively straightforward, but it's much harder to read. So, we prefer the version given in class.

 In proving a greedy algorithm, we create(assume) an optimal solution which is different from greedy.
 
 Then, we find the first position where the optimal solution is different from the greedy solution.
 
 Then, we show that switching that element of optimal solution to greedy element is still optimal. This way, the length of the segment where greedy and optimal are identical has increased by 1.
 
 For the remaining parts, we repeat the process above again. We find the first position where greedy and optimal differs, and do the same process.
 
 Repeat the process until there is no element left. Here, we finally have an optimal solution which is exactly identical to greedy solution.
 
 I don't really get the final step.

I can't answer your question definitively because the actual phrasing depends upon how you have set up your proof.One way to do it is to A) Assume that greedy is not an optimal solution.B) Let $$G$$ be the greedy solution and $$O$$ be some optimal solution.C) Let $$d$$ be some ""similarity"" measure between $$G$$ and $$O$$ In your case, you are letting $$d$$ be the ""first place"" that $$G$$ and $$O$$ differD) Create a new optimal solution $$O'$$ whose similarity with $$G$$ is greater.E) You then need to explain that the similarity value is bounded and if it gets large enough (explaining what large enough is) then $$G=O$$In some problems (E) is obvious and in some (E ) needs to be explained in more detail.That really depends upon what your similarity measure is.This proof can also be done by contradiction. You can define a similarity measure and then say. If $$G$$ is not optimal let $$O$$ be an optimal solution that has the highest similarity measure with $$G$$.

 Within my knowledge, input is:
 
 [5, 1, History] // add course 1, name: History
 
 [5, 2, C++] // add course 2, name: C++
 
 [5, 3, Python] // add course 3, name: Python

 [3, 1] // display comments of course 1

 So student 1 (Tom) has a comment on course 1 and course 3, and student 2 (John) has a comment on course 2.
 
 Shouldn't the ranks_count for Tom 2 and for John 1?
