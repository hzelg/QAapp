Essentially, both of these would be doing subtraction of x - y, the only difference is that for set less than, AFTER the ALU operations it would check if bit 0 of the output is 1 (x - y < 0). So why is there any difference in the ALU Control signal when calculation is similar INSIDE the ALU?

$at is a register typically for the assembler to support the ""pseudo instruction"" -> ""real MIPS instruction"" conversions, but you can use it, it is not a reserved register (unlike the $gp, $fp, $sp registers).

You are NOT asked to change the register values, you only need to change the registers when the execution outcome of the instruction would change their values.

Write the instructions like what you would do in MARS, provide clearly the instruction name, the register names, immediate value, label(write the offset directly), or any other relevant information.

The third instruction depends on the ""lw"" and the earlier ""add"" instructions on $s1 and $s2 respectively. Forwarding only exists from ALU output->ALU inputs, so the earliest time the third instruction can get the updated $s1 value (i.e. by doing ID) is in (the second half of) the clock cycle 5 after after ""lw"" is done with WB (in the first half of the clock cycle). But then if you align this third instruction accordingly, you will notice that it will not be able to get updated value of $s2 from the earlier ""add"" (i.e. the required forwarding is Mem->ALU, but this does not exist according to the problem description). Therefore the only way to get the updated value of $s2 is through ID, and therefore the third instruction can only do ID when the earlier ""add"" is done with WB in the first half of clock cycle 6.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not necessary. First line of the problem states that $$n \ge 2.$$
Your code may also assume that assumption for the data. SO, an exception is not needed.

Since the exception case is not needed this is not an issue

>3. For question 4, is it possible to define a separate helper function other than Inside(P, q)?
Yes. You may define procedures and functions with your pseudocode.


>Edit: One extra question about the requirements; when it says to start new problem on new page, does that include >sub sections (a, b, i, ii, etc.) or just the large problem 1,2,3,4 should start on a new page?

Just every large problem, i.e., 1, 2 3 and 4.

Rubab",0,Updated 3 years ago by Loading...,"I just want to confirm if “item” in this problem means key,
Technically, no. It’s an item. Multiple items may have the same key. This can occur with Binary Search Trees as well. An item may be a record and multiple records might have the same key.

But, if it makes it simpler, for the sake of this problem, you may assume that all items have unique keys.
Just specify in advance that you are using that assumption.

so in (II) and (III), the input is a key and we have to find the node(s) that contain(s) the key
Or some node that contains the key (if there are multiple such nodes). The same as for BSTs)


or insert the key in some node (respectively).
Not exactly. In this last case you need to create a new tree that contains all the old keys and the new key.

The easiest way to do this is to try to insert the key into the appropriate leaf and then, if the resulting tree violates the rules, fix that.

If yes, if more than one node contain the key do we have to find all the nodes in (II)? In (III), are we allowed to change the number of nodes?
No. The resulting tree must contain exactly all of the old items in the tree as well as the new item that has been inserted

More specifically, the general statement is that

Showing that this formally correct requires induction.

The base case is that it is true for $i=1$.

Now assume, by induction, that (*) is true for $i-1$, i.e,
$$T(n) = 2^{i-1}T(n-(i-1)) + \sum_{j=0}^{i-2}2^j$$

So, proving that $$T(n) \le c \log_3 n$$ for all $n > n_0$ (which is what it means to prove that T(n)=O(log (base 3) n) IS proving that $$T(n) = O( \log n)$$.

No. You need to prove the correctness of your bases case(s) and then prove your general induction step separately.

I'm not quite sure how it's even possible (in a clean induction for these problems ) for the base case and the general case to be similar.
The base case is usually proving something like ""my statement is correct for $$n=1,2$$;

If you can come up with an induction hypothesis that permits using weak induction, by all means use it.

BUT, when proving correctness of a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm it can be messy to use weak induction. That's because problems of size n usually do NOT recursively call problems of size $$n-1$$. They call SMALLER subproblems. So, Strong induction is more natural in this case and I recommend using it.

All of the (informal) ""proofs"" of correctness that we have done in class have actually used strong induction.

I want to ask does that order matter, in other words, if I have a array A[i] of size n to fill in, it’s ok for a DP algorithm to fill in A[n] as the initial case, move to the left and return A[1] at the end?",0,Updated 3 years ago by Anonymous Gear,"Not exactly.
IN the BST problem for example, we fill in A[i,j] by order of increasing SIZE l = j - i +1.

The idea in DP is to solve larger problems by using information known about smaller problems.
So, you need to fill in the table entries for the smaller subproblems before filling in the entries for the larger subproblems.

In practice, when you have a one parameter DP table A[i], i ""usually"" denotes the size of the problem, so you can't go wrong by filling it in in increasing order of i, which is why we do it that way.


********************************************************
Deeper Dive (not needed for this class but puts things in perspective)
In more advanced courses we sometimes view the DP table as a directed graph.

The entries in the table are the graph vertices and there is an edge from entry A to entry A_ if you need to know the value in entry A to calculate the value in entry A_.

The Directed graph MUST be acyclic. Otherwise, it would not be possible to fill in the table.

So, it's a DAG (directed acyclic graph)

Since it's a DAG, the vertices, i.e., table entries, can be topologically sorted (ordered)
ANY topological ordering of the table entries can be used to fill in the table,
That's because, in a topological ordering an entry A_ will only be visited if all the entries pointing to it have been visited, which means that all those entries have already been evaluated, which means that we have enough information to evaluate A.

The orders that we give you in class are always topological orderings of the table. They're usually not the only ones, though. Just the ""simplest"" to describe.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If $$i > j$$ then the tree exists, but it is empty, so it has cost $$0.$$While this might seem arbitrary, this is actually how the recurrence taught in class worked.The issue there was that, when constructing $$T_{i,j}$$, it is possible that $$a_i$$ or $$a_j$$ is the root.In that case, the left or right subtree would be empty. The recurrence therefore needed the cost of that empty subtree to be $$0$$. This is why we set $$e[i,i-1]=0$$ in class.[Sidenote: Setting $$e[i,i-1]=0$$ was just a mathematical hack. BUT, introducing it meant that we didn't have to write out special cases of the recurrence when the root is the leftmost or rightmost item in the range. So, it was a useful hack.]The cases in which we nust set $$e[i,j:k] = \infty$$ are very different. These are cases in which the range of items is non-empty but the tree with the stated property can not exist. For example, the tree containing a range with 4 items ($$a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}$$) MUST have height at least $$2$$. So $$e[i,i+3:1]=\infty$$Again, this is a mathematical hack. You COULD write a more complicated recurrence that first checks whether a tree could exist before calculating its associated value. But, setting the cost $$=\infty$$ does this automatically.This is actually why we permit you to do calculations with $$\infty$$ in your pseudocode. In real code, that's impossible. You would need to keep a boolean indicator of the existence of a tree of that size and check that before doing a value calculation.

""Initial conditions"" refers to the base conditions that need to be set.
These are the values that are NOT defined by the recurrence.

There are actually two slightly different types of initial conditions that can occur.

a) those that refer to the ""smallest"" base problems, i.e.,
$$e[i,i] = f(a_i).$$
These are the costs of the one node trees

b) Those that refer to boundary issues in the recurrence, e.g.
$$f(i,j)=0$$ for $$i>j.$$
$$i >j$$ refers to non-existent problem, e.g., the empty set.
Setting this $$-0$$ is saying that the cost of an empty tree is zero.
and makes the recurrence work nicely.

Both types are called initial conditions

***********************
A bit deeper. For this problem, (b) was not actually necessary.
You could have avoided this mathematical hack by not defining $$e[i,j]$$ for $$i > j$$ and changing the recurrence to

$$e[i,j] = w[i,j] + \min\left( e[i+1,j], e[i,j-1], \min_{i < k < j} (e_[i,k-1]+e[ k+1,j])\right)$$

Note that this new recurrence has peeled off the two cases of $$a_i$$ and $$a_j$$ being the tree roots and dealt with them separately. It's also mathematically correct and, possibly, more intuitively straightforward, but it's much harder to read. So, we prefer the version given in class.

In proving a greedy algorithm, we create(assume) an optimal solution which is different from greedy.

Then, we show that switching that element of optimal solution to greedy element is still optimal. This way, the length of the segment where greedy and optimal are identical has increased by 1.

For the remaining parts, we repeat the process above again. We find the first position where greedy and optimal differs, and do the same process.

Repeat the process until there is no element left. Here, we finally have an optimal solution which is exactly identical to greedy solution.

In the instructor's post posted on last Friday (@223), it gave us hints about solving recurrence by top-down approach, which is:
- Setting the base case at top level
- Denoting the recurrence formula as ""maximum value of a path that starts from node $$(1,1)$$ and ends at node $$(i, j)$$""

However, after looking up some resources from the internet, I learnt that this problem can also be solved by solving recurrence using bottom-up approach, which is:
- Setting base cases at the bottom level

- Denoting the recurrence formula as ""maximum value of a sub-path starting from node $$(i, j)$$, and moving down as deep as possible, satisfying the given conditions at the same time""

This made me raise a question: Is it acceptable for using bottom-up approach instead of top-down approach for any or all parts in this problem? Thanks!",0,Updated 3 years ago by Anonymous Atom,"While it might be possible to solve it bottom up, that's much more complicated to get correct than top down.


1) The statement
""maximum value of a sub-path starting from node (i,j), and moving down as deep as possible, satisfying the given conditions at the same time""
has no meaning. I really don't know what you intend.
If you wrote something like that in your submission we would mark it wrong since it's too ambiguous.

It's hard for me to answer your question since I have no idea what is being asked.

Does ""deep as possible"" mean to go all the way to the bottom level i.e., a vertex $$(h,j)$$?
If yes, write that. If not, I don't understand what you are suggesting


3) Please read the assignment rules carefully.
A ""Path"" is DEFINED as something that starts from $$(1,1)$$.
In part (b) and (c) the paths do NOT have to end on the bottom level of the graph.
They can end somewhere in the middle
If your recurrence is storing the value of the max path with the property that goes from $$(i,j)$$ to the bottom. That's not what is being requested. Using that to get the value requested will take yet another level of work


4) The problem was designed so that the technique you use for part (a) can be modified to be used on part (b) and (c) using the same basic notation and terminology. If you swap methods between the sections you will have to write a lot more.


The short answer to your question is that, while it might be possible to develop a bottom up solution it will be much harder and also much more complicate to write directly and almost certain to contain errors.

I have proofed (S,T) is an s-t cut with minimum capacity.

I have also proofed that the value of maximum flow is equal to the maximum number of edge-disjoint path.

Then how to proof that (S,T) is a cut with number of edges equal to maximum number of edge-disjoint paths?",0,Updated 3 years ago by Anonymous Atom,"You can NOT use the edge-disjoint path method for part 1(b)

You are not looking for min separating edge set
You are looking for what I call a min-$$E'_1$$ separating edge set

that is, look at all the separating edge sets that only have edges in $$E'_1$$ and take a set from that collection with the smallest number of edges.

You need to prove

- if $$(S',T')$$ is a min capacity cut, then $$E(S',T')$$ only contains edges in $$E'_1.$$

- That $$C(S',T') = E(S',T')$$ (this would follow from the fact that $$E(S',T') \subseteq E'_1.$$)

Since if $$S,T$$ s a cut, $$E(S,T)$$ is a separating edge set

This would then let you derive that

$$|f^*| = C(S',T') = |E(S',T')| \ge |EC|$$

You now need to prove that $$|EC| \ge |f^*|.$$


Ome way to do this is, given $$EC$$ create a new set $$S^*$$ that consists of all the vertices that can be reached from $$s_r$$ without using any edge in $$EC$$

Then $$S^*,T=V - S^*$$ is a cut.


NOW PROVE that $$E(S^*,T^*) \subseteq EC$$ (this is the main thing that needs to be shown).

Since $$S',T'$$ is a min capacity cut,
$$C(S',T) \le C(S^*,T^*).$$

Combining the pieces
$$|f^*| = C(S',T) \le C(S^*,T^*) = |E(C^*,T^*)| \le |EC|$$

DP1 means a Dynamic program with one variable, e.g., $$V[i].$$

DP2 means a Dynamic program with two variables, $$V[i,j]$$.

The meaning of the parameters, $$i,j$$ are very problem dependent and the domain in which $$V[i,j]$$ is defined is also very problem dependent.

DP over intervals are a special case of DP2.
They model problems in which we have some linear order of items 1,2,3...n
and the domain is ""intervals"" $$i \ldots j$$

This is so common in practice that we give it a name ""DP over intervals""""

One minor issue with DPs is that, after finding the recurrence, you need to figure out some order in which to fill in the table. Again, this can be very problem dependent.

For DP over intervals, we can (almost) always fill it in the table in order of increasing ""problem size'', i.e., interval size, $$l=j-i.$$",1,2,,"It is similar to DP2, but the difference is that it uses the window size (
l=i_j

j=1 to m

My proof:

I used induction to proof

The proof for m=1 to m-1 is same as solution

The proof for no false positive occurs is same as solution

Now suppose that X is a subsequence of Y, i.e. there exists some sequence of indices $$j_1<j_2<...<j_m$$ such that, for all
$$1≤i≤m, x_i = y_{j_i}$$. Then

$$j_1<j_2$$ so $$j_1+1\leq j_2$$

$$x_2...x_m$$ is a subsequence of $$y_{j_2}...y_m$$

$$\Rightarrow x_2...x_m$$ is a subsequence of $$y_{j_1+1}...y_m$$

In step c, when $$i = 1$$, the greedy algorithm finds $$x_1 == y_{j_1}$$.
After that, it is as if it is running the algorithm to find if $$x_2 . . . x_m$$ is a subsequence of $$y_{j_1+1} . . . y_m$$.

But, by the induction hypothesis, the algorithm gives the correct answer for this.

Thus, for $$m$$, if $$X$$ is a subsequence of $$Y$$ the algorithm will correctly report “success”.

Is the proof correct?",0,Updated 2 years ago by Anonymous Mouse,"The ""bug"" in your proof is that you wrote
>""In step c, when $$i = 1$$, the greedy algorithm finds $$x_1 == y_{j_1}$$.""

The problem here is that there's no specification of which $$y$$ value the algorithm found to match $$x_1.$$ You need to claim that it finds the first one and then explicitly use that fact in the remainder of the proof.

So far I understand that in a 1-D array, using the below example,
int x[] = {11,22,33,44};
int* xp = x;I know that since



xp + N == &x + sizeof(<type>) _ N, xp - N== &x - sizeof(<type>) _ N,
in the above example:

xp == x == &x[0]
xp+1 == x+1 == &x[1]
xp+2 == x+2 == &x[2].



However, what I don't understand is how this works in multi-dimensional array. I don't really understand what the lecture slide means. It is said that (in lecture slide, Pointer):




x == &x[0] != &x[0][0]




&x[j] == x+j




x[j] == &x[j][0]

In addition, you cannot initialize the variable-size array like your code. You need to use a loop.

Here is a modified example to illustrate why using variable-sized array is a bad idea.

The program looks good when n is small. But when n is large, your program crashes (it is a runtime error, not a compilation error). Even worse, you basically don't know the minimum value n that causes the runtime error. In other words, your program may suddenly crash.

If possible, always create a fixed size array (if you know the size of the array, and the size is quite small), or use dynamic allocation (it is possible to handle the failure by using exception handling technique).

682 | }

| ^",1,Updated 1 month ago by Anonymous Helix,These warnings are usually okay.,1,2,,"See @96.



---

This means that in your updateMapForMoveAction() function, not all possible paths have a return value. E.g., if you have a function int modulo3(int)

int modulo3(int num) {
if (num % 3 == 0) return 0;
else if (num % 3 == 1) return 1;
else if (num % 3 == 2) return 2;
// The compiler may think it's possible for your program to reach here.
}

Although you know that this has covered all the possible cases of num (does it?), the compiler may not be smart enough to understand it. The only thing it knows is that your if doesn't have an else part and it thinks that it's possible that it reaches the end of the if block and exit the function without returning.

Then the compiler may throw warnings at you for not returning in a non-void function.

Usually as good practice, it is encouraged to return in every return path even if you think some path is impossible to reach since it's easier to debug this way.

Why? For the above example, what if the input num is negative? In C++11, negative modulo positive gives negative number. Then your compound if block will not be able to catch that case. This kind of bugs can be insidious at times.

If you do not always return, the function can return indeterministic value (actually its UB, meaning your program can crash), which is usually very hard to debug since the output may be different every time, causing inconsistent behavior.

However, if you always return, say return some placeholder value (e.g. -1) for return paths that is ""impossible to reach"", it's easier to debug since you will know there is something unexpected happening in that function. Consistently incorrect behaviour is better than inconsistent behaviour (undefined behavior).

I understand that after a robot's hp becomes 0, it should be removed from the map and its hp value in the array should be set to 0 also, so displayHealthPoints will consider the robot not being alive. However, nothing is stopping a player to perform actions on a destroyed robot. Out of the 4 return value options for a move action, NOT_IMPLEMENTED should not be returned in a finished code, SUCCESS does not make sense since the destroyed robot should not even exist, let alone move to another location, and OUTSIDE_BOUNDARY and HIT_ANOTHER_ROBOT_ALONG_PATH do not make sense as well since that is not the situation (assume the move action would be valid if the robot was alive), so what should be returned? 

Since the main function only filters out robotLetter == CHAR_END_INPUT, any other invalid input for robotLetter (e.g. a robot that does not exist, so if only robots A, B, C are on the map and player tries to operate D) would still be passed through to the corresponding actionLetter codes and cause the same situation where the options for return do not make sense.

Do we must use induction to prove the correctness of our algorithm in these problems? Or, can we explain the idea and why it works correctly in words? Thanks!",0,Updated 3 years ago by Anonymous Gear,"That really depend upon how clear your proofs are.
Normally, most proofs of this type will use induction IMPLICTLY without explicitly specifying an induction hypothesis.
That works if you can write very clear explanations.
If not, you will get points deducted for being ambiguous and not having a good enough explanation.
My recommendation to students is that they be as formal as possible at the start of the semester. As the semester progresses and they learn how to write clear proofs, they can become more informal.
As a side note

can we explain the idea and why it works correctly in words?
This question has nothing to do with induction.
Even if you don’t use induction you should still be using mathematical symbols to define concepts formally., especially in problem 1.

Most explanations I’ve seen that only use words are too ambiguous to be marked as correct.
In problem 2, there’s not as much need for mathematical symbols but you still need a formal partition of the problem into separate clearly defined cases and then show to recurse on those cases. That can’t be done properly just using words, It needs some formal structure.
My recommendation in general is to use both mathematics and words.

That depends upon what you mean by “attribute”
AVL trees store records indexed by a key. If the attribute you are referring to is the full point data, then yes, you may store a point with its associated (x-coordinate) key.

If you mean expanding the AVL trees to store some other TREE data, e.g., a pointer to successor, the answer is
No. More specifically, you can use AVL trees as a black box.
But, if you want to change them at all, then you need to fully describe the changes and prove their correctness and running time).

Not true. The INSERTION into an AVL tree takes O(log n) time

You can NOT index on “minimum cost”. For one thing, cost doesn’t even have to be a rational number. For another, there are an exponential number of possible costs that can occur. You don’t have the time to index over all of them.
