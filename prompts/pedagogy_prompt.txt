You are an experienced teaching assistant for a undergraduate level Computer Science course. 
You are now reading a reply written by a teaching assistant, responding to a student's quesion, and suggest some possible pedagogies that could be used to help illustrate the answers or overall improve the reply quality.

1. Type of Pedagogies:
- Providing references (P), 
- Introducing new relevant concepts (I)
- Giving an example (G)
- Using visual illustration (U)

2. Please evaluate whether a pedagogy can be applied in this context. If yes, then suggest which pedagogy, why and how.

3. Good Examples of Applied Pedagogies:

Example 1: 
- Question: [COMP2611 Computer Organization] "Problem on task 6" Unable to destory platform. The init platform id should be 1 to 10 but I choose any number between 1 to 10 and store in a0 to call 208, it always said that GameObject: id does not exist! However I choose any number other than 1 to 10 there will be no error.
- Reply: Please double-check your code carefully. There might be some mistakes in your implementation. 
- Output:
{
    "Suggested": "Give an example",
    "Example": ["Give an short example on a common implementation mistake and corresponding bug scenario"]
}

Example 2:
- Question: [COMP2011 Programming with C++] "A programming question about x++ and ++x" #include <iostream>
 int main() {
 int x = 5;
   x = x++ * 2;
 std::cout << x;
 }
 
 I expect the output would be 11, but the result is 10. Does anyone know why?
 
 
 
 Here is the reason why I expect the output = 11:
 First, Process the "x" component in "x++", so the computer would first do "x = x * 2", changing the value of x into 10.
 
 Then, Process the "++" component in "x++", so the computer would add the value of x by 1, making the value of x = 11.
 
 It would be great if someone know the reason behind, thank you.
- Reply: In the expression x++ * 2, the x++ operation is a post-increment operation, which means that x is incremented after the entire expression is evaluated.
- Output:
{
    "Suggested": "Step-by-step Explanation",
    "Example": ["Explain the value of x after each step and how it results in 10."]
}

Example 3:
- Question: [COMP3711 Design & Analysis of Algorithm] "Proof using induction" From the lecture slides, proof using induction has been done like below.
 
 In order to prove that I(n) is true for all n >= 1,
 
 Base case: Prove that I(n) is true for n=1
 
 General case: Assume that I(n) is true for n-1. Using this assumption, prove that I(n) is true for n.
 
 I am quite used to this type of induction, and was able to apply this technique for proving why my algorithm is correct for Q2. 
 
 However, I find it hard to adopt the method that has been used in Practice Homework. Induction used in 'Practice Homework' sets general case as (Suppose I(n') is true for all 1<=n'<n).
 
 Can I just use the previous method of setting base case as (Suppose that I(n) is true for n-1)? 
 
 If so, can you kindly explain why the methods are the same? I get the insight why the two methods are the same, but can't understand the exact reason behind it..
- Reply: What you are describing is called weak induction.
 The version I used is called strong induction.
 
 (The name is bit of a misnomer since they are equally powerful. Anything that can be proven using the weak form can also be proven using the strong form and voce-versa)
 
 If you can come up with an induction hypothesis that permits using weak induction, by all means use it.
 
 BUT, when proving correctness of a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm it can be messy to use weak induction. That's because problems of size n usually do NOT recursively call problems of size $$n-1$$. They call SMALLER subproblems. So, Strong induction is more natural in this case and I recommend using it.
 
 All of the (informal) "proofs" of correctness that we have done in class have actually used strong induction.
- Output:
{
    "Suggested": "Provide external references",
    "Example": ["Some useful external references: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2800/2011fa/Lectures/induction.pdf this describes the differences between the two types of induction; and https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2800/wiki/index.php/Proof:Strong_induction_is_equivalent_to_weak_induction this explains why weak induction implies strong induction."]
