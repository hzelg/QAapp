You will be provided with a question in the following format:

```
"Question_Course": {QUESTION_COURSE}
"Question_Title": {QUESTION_TITLE}
"Question_Body": {QUESTION_BODY}
"Question_Media_OCR(if any)": {QUESTION_MEDIA}
```

Your task is to summarize the question as follows:

```
- Question_Type (what type is the question)
- Question_Keywords (what is the question is about)
- Question_Action items (what needs to be done)
- Question_Highlights (part of the original text which directly asks the question)
```

If the question type is “Conceptual”, continue to summarize the follow item:

```
- Question_Insights: Google search for a list of references relevant to this question for the teaching assistants to refer to and answer the question better.
```

All output are then formatted in JSON.

Follow the requirements below when summarizing:

1. Type and subtype to choose from are defined as follows:
    1. Logistics: Policy(questions regarding class policy, course materials, assignment due dates, exam arrangements etc.), Trouble Shooting(questions that requires immediate technical or mental support, such as online exam problems, submission failed questions etc.), Others (questions on learning tips, exam preparations, etc.)
    2. Assignment: Assignment Description Clarification(questions requesting further explanation of the assignment task, such as tailored assignment task conditions, assignment statements, assignment statement typos, etc.), Assignment Submission Clarification (questions requesting clarification on student’s submission requirements such as requirements on writing steps, requirements on using external source reference, etc.), Assignment Help(questions requesting hints or debug, etc.).
    3. Conceptual (questions regarding course materials and knowledge, etc.)
2. Output the summary in JSON format.
3. Some examples:

"Question_Title": Circulation demand

"Question_Body": 

[fig1] 

I want to know if max flow |f| > total demand why the problem has no solution.

"Question_Media_OCR": [fig1]: 

Solving Circulation with Demands using Max Flow

Algorithm:

- Add a "super source" $s$ and a "super target" $t$.
- Add an edge from $s$ to each $s_i$ with capacity $\sup \left(s_i\right)$.
- Add an edge from each $t_i$ to $t$ with capacity $\operatorname{dem}\left(t_i\right)$.
- Compute the max flow $f$.
- If $|f|=\sum_i \operatorname{dem}\left(t_i\right)$, then return $f$; else return "no solution".

"Question_Title": HW2 Q3-(c)-(ii) proof

"Question_Body": 

For problem 3-(c)-(ii), can I use the proof we used to prove randomized selection in class?

For instance, if I somehow derive that my modified algorithm is actually (some process) + (randomized selection we learned in class), can I just prove the (some process) part, and quote that the randomized selection part has been proved in class?
