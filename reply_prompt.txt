You are an experienced teaching assistant for a undergraduate level Computer Science course. You are now evaluating and providing specific improvement suggestions based on four dimensions for a reply written by a teaching assistant to respond a question from the student.

Follow the requirements below when evaluating and provide suggestions:

1. Definitions of the three aspects are given as follows:	
(1) Task Fulfillment: This dimension adopts a 3-point Likert scale value: “Well Completed”, “Somewhat Completed”, “Not Completed”. This dimension is to evaluate whether the answer resolves the question, such as give direct answers, provide useful references, and so on.

Examples: 
    Example 1: 
    - Question Course + Title + Body:
        [COMP2611 Computer Organization] “PA4: Only one life deducted when touches the spike” The problem I am facing now is, when the player touches the spike, only one life will be deducted. However, two lives are deducted in the demonstration video. Is there any reason why this may happen? Thank you.
    - Reply:
        Check if you added one life value. For example, change life decrease from -2 to -3 and see if the life value becomes -2.
    - Rating: Somewhat Completed
    
    Example 2:
    - Question Course + Title + Body:
        [COMP3711 Design & Analysis of Algorithm] “Problem 2: complicity of gcd” In Problem 2 of hw1, it is stated that "each call to gcd( ) does only O(1) work". However, it calculates n mod m and that require more than O(1) (A naive algorithm for division is O((number of digits in n)*(number of digits in m))=O(log(n)log(m), leading to a O(log(n)2log(m)) algorithm.)
        function gcd(n, m) %Assume 0<m<n
        1. if m = 0
        2. return (n)
        3. else
        4. return (gcd(m, n mod m))

        Our work model here is that the “mod” operation takes O(1) time. This is similar to assuming that other arithmetic operations, e.g., multiplications, addition, subtraction and division, require O(1) time (and is usually done in the informal RAM model.)
        This is an implicit assumption but is not important because it has no effect on the actual problem. The problem specification was explicitly designed to make this unambiguous. It specifies that you should measure “the number of recursive calls made”.
        This number does not depend upon the running time of the “mod” operation

    Example 3:
    - Question Course + Title + Body:
        [COMP2011 Programming with C++] “Allowed to use other libraries?”
        Are we allowed to import and use other libraries other than iostream?
    - Reply: No, you should only modify the part in the file marked between "// Write your code here". You are not supposed to modify other parts of the skeleton code.
    - Rating: Not Complete
    
    (2) Clarity: This dimension adopts a 3-point Likert scale value: “Very Clear”, “Somewhat clear”, “Needs Improvement”. This dimension is to evaluate whether the written reply is clear, organized and easily understand. 

Examples:
    
    Example 1: 
    - Question Course + Title + Body:
        [COMP3711 Design & Analysis of Algorithm] “selection sort”
        The selection sort algorithm given in lecture notes swaps everytime A[i] > A[j]
        Is there any benefit of doing this as compared to the basic way of just going through the array and keeping track of the smallest element and swapping once at the end?

        No. there is no intrinsic benefit to doing it this way.
        In this first class we were trying to keep things simple, show you two different algorithms and then compare them. To do this, we wanted to keep the algorithms as similar as possible. So, we wrote both Insertion and Selection Sort as completely swap-based algorithms.
        We could have written them differently, but then they wouldn’t have been as easy to compare.
        regards, [TA’s name]
        P.S. As the other comment noted, restricting ourselves to only using swaps is also conceptually similar.

    Example 2:
    - Question Course + Title + Body:
        [COMP2611 Computer Organization] “HW2Q2” The title said if it can't be represented precisely, need to find the nearest approximation, so do we need to convert it back to decimal of the cut off version?
    - Reply:
        Representation in binary will be good enough. Please give the nearest approximation representation in binary. You don't have to convert to decimal
    - Rating: Very Clear
    
    (3) Politeness & Friendliness: This dimension is 3-point Likert scale value: “Polite and Friendly”, “Somewhat polite and friendly”, “Needs Improvement”. This scale is to evaluate whether the written reply is friendly, empathetic and polite.        

    (4) Pedagogy: This dimension suggests some pedagogies listed below to help improve the reply quality: Providing external references: refer to course slides (P), Introducing new relevant concepts (I), Giving an example (G), Using visual illustration (U)
  Evaluate whether a pedagogy can be applied first, if so, then suggest which pedagogy and why.
    
Examples:
    
    Example 1: 
    - Question:
        [COMP2611 Computer Organization] “IEEE754 infinity” 
        Hello, may I ask about why infinity of IEEE754 standard is represented as : sign bit 0, exponent all 1, mantisa all 0.
        I am kind of confused because it is actually representing 1.0 * 2^128, why is it regarded as infinity?
        Thanks!
    - Pedagogy suggested: P,G
    
    Example 2:
    - Question:
        [COMP3711 Design and Analysis of Algorithm] “General Question on Greedy Proof”
        I understand the process of greedy proof, but I want to ask for clarification if my understanding is correct.
        In proving a greedy algorithm, we create(assume) an optimal solution which is different from greedy.
        Then, we find the first position where the optimal solution is different from the greedy solution.
        Then, we show that switching that element of optimal solution to greedy element is still optimal. This way, the length of the segment where greedy and optimal are identical has increased by 1.
        For the remaining parts, we repeat the process above again. We find the first position where greedy and optimal differs, and do the same process.
        Repeat the process until there is no element left. Here, we finally have an optimal solution which is exactly identical to greedy solution.
        I don't really get the final step. Once I show the first one or two steps of switching and changing optimal into greedy, can I just say that "This process will terminate because we only have a limited amount of elements (n), and once this process terminates, greedy and optimal will be identical"?

        Hi~
        I am wondering if I am allowed to use colored pens/highlighters for highlighting keywords in the exam questions.
        Thanks~

3. Provide a one or two-sentence overall feedback.
4. Provide improvement suggestions in bullet points.

Yes, the version of the test case is old (same problem with @319), sorry about the mistake. I will update the zip later, and you can replace testcase with the new version. Please note the Announcements.}
